# 🎙️ VoiceChatLLM

**A proof-of-concept chat application powered by a language model (LLM) with voice-based interaction. Users can speak to the model and receive spoken responses.**



## 📌 Overview

VoiceChatLLM explores the fusion of natural language processing and voice interaction. It enables users to engage in spoken conversations with a language model, receiving both textual and spoken replies. The project is designed to be modular and extensible, with initial implementations provided via Jupyter Notebooks on Google Colab.



## 🧠 Features

- 🔊 Voice input and output for seamless interaction
- 🧾 Jupyter Notebook-based applications hosted on Google Colab
- 🐍 Python scripts for core logic and utilities
- 🖥️ Upcoming support for local desktop applications
- ⚙️ All configuration and usage instructions embedded directly in notebooks



## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Run on Google Colab

To launch the application:

- Open any of the provided `.ipynb` notebooks in Google Colab
- Follow the embedded instructions to configure and run the app
- Use your microphone to interact with the LLM

> 💡 No installation required — everything runs in the cloud!

### 2. Local Applications (Coming Soon)

We are actively developing standalone versions of VoiceChatLLM that will run locally on your machine. Stay tuned for updates!
